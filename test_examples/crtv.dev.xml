In this post, I discuss the need for this tool, my process of building it, and how to install it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-magic-links">What Are &quot;Magic&quot; Links?</h2>
<p>The Cloudflare dashboard supports several deep link variables (affectionately known as magic links by the community) to make sharing links into the dashboard easier. These links work by replacing various IDs found within the dashboard&apos;s URLs with variables that are intercepted by the deep linker. When a user visits a link like in the example found below, they&apos;re shown a selection screen to choose the Cloudflare account they would like to use, then directed to select the zone they&apos;d like to use. </p>
<div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Read all about Accounts vs. Zones vs. Profiles <a href="https://crtv.dev/how-to-add-users-to-a-cloudflare-account/#:~:text=As%20a%20prerequisite%2C%20let%27s%20take%20a%20quick%20moment%20to%20look%20at%20three%20different%20Cloudflare%20terms%20that%20will%20be%20important%3A%20Zones%2C%20Profiles%2C%20and%20Accounts." rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</div></div>
<p>After making both selections, they&apos;re redirected, in this case, to the Zaraz tools configuration page.</p>
<pre><code>https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/zaraz/tools-config/tools</code></pre>
<p>...converts into...</p>
<pre><code>https://dash.cloudflare.com/1234567890poiuytrewq/bogus.studio/zaraz/tools-config/tools</code></pre>
<p>This feature of the dashboard is extremely useful for sharing links in blog posts like this, helping others in GitHub issues or forums, or sharing links with coworkers. But before now, the only way to create them was to manually replace the values or to use a bot within the <a href="https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev?ref=crtv.dev">Cloudflare Discord community</a>.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-extension">Building the Extension</h2>
<p>I&apos;ve built several extensions before (mostly for removing ads on random sites and other random customizations that <a href="https://arc.net/?ref=crtv.dev">Arc</a> could probably replace), but never have I published one of the Chrome Webstore. The process itself isn&apos;t hard; you mostly just have to pay $5 to create a developer account and fill out some paperwork saying you&apos;re not loading remote code and that you&apos;re not doing anything sketchy with user data. </p>
<p>Still, the documentation leaves much to be desired. The manifest v3 migration, which I have heard lots of rumors suggesting is designed to make tools like adblockers less effective, seems to have caused a bit of chaos as far as documentation goes. The documentation is there, but it&apos;s hard to tell what version it&apos;s for; I found several broken links within Google&apos;s own help docs, and the general process feels chaotic. Thankfully, the actual functionality of my extension is relatively basic, with a <a href="https://github.com/mackenly/cloudflare-magic-linker/blob/main/manifest.json?ref=crtv.dev">simple manifest</a>, a small bit of <a href="https://github.com/mackenly/cloudflare-magic-linker/blob/main/src/popup.html?ref=crtv.dev">HTML </a>+ <a href="https://github.com/mackenly/cloudflare-magic-linker/blob/main/src/styles/popup.css?ref=crtv.dev">CSS</a>, and straightforward <a href="https://github.com/mackenly/cloudflare-magic-linker/blob/main/src/scripts/popup.js?ref=crtv.dev">JavaScript</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Javascript">{
    &quot;manifest_version&quot;: 3,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Cloudflare Magic Linker&quot;,
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Create magic deep links for the Cloudflare dashboard.&quot;,
    &quot;icons&quot;: {
        &quot;128&quot;: &quot;src/images/icon128.png&quot;
    },
    &quot;action&quot;: {
        &quot;default_popup&quot;: &quot;src/popup.html&quot;
    },
    &quot;host_permissions&quot;: [
        &quot;https://dash.cloudflare.com/*&quot;,
        &quot;https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/*&quot;
    ]
}</code></pre>
<p>I think the most challenging part was creating the extension&apos;s icon, but ChatGPT was able to come to the rescue and, on the first try, generated an icon that looked exactly as I wanted.</p>

<h2 id="community-feedback-and-collaboration">Community Feedback and Collaboration</h2>
<p>One of the most valuable parts of Cloudflare as a company is its community of users. After creating a quick MVP of the extension, I decided to make it public and ask the community for feedback and if anyone was aware of any more deep link variables that could be used (I don&apos;t think they&apos;re documented anywhere, at least publically). Within the community Discord, I <a href="https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/1190097743167893524?ref=crtv.dev">created a post</a> asking for feedback where several community members quickly added helpful comments and suggestions. A big shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/Cherry?ref=crtv.dev">James</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Tyler-OBrien?ref=crtv.dev">Chaika</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Erisa?ref=crtv.dev">Erisa</a> for bringing up the <code>:pages-deployment</code> variable and that Zero Trust supports <code>:account</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-extension">Using the Extension</h2>
<p>To try out the extension yourself, you can either install it from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fongdcpejhfehpdcahcjncgfhkepoico?ref=crtv.dev">Chrome Webstore</a> like a normal Chrome extension or load it unpacked from the source using developer mode by <a href="https://github.com/mackenly/cloudflare-magic-linker?ref=crtv.dev">cloning the repository</a> to your local machine. The source code is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/mackenly/cloudflare-magic-linker/blob/main/LICENSE?ref=crtv.dev">GPL-3.0 license</a> and is open to issues and PRs.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fongdcpejhfehpdcahcjncgfhkepoico?ref=crtv.dev"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Cloudflare Magic Linker</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Create magic deep links for the Cloudflare dashboard.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/chrome/webstore/images/icon_144px.png" alt="Cloudflare Magic Linker: Chrome Extension Project"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Chrome Web Store</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UPdc4DhIl_aTLbJCnlNefgYtTVTutW43Y5gg3sYY-4l9oSp1w9LTZalU5dzf6H0VU6doloseUNgAdmAFBlkIXEMV5Q=w128-h128-e365-rj-sc0x00ffffff" alt="Cloudflare Magic Linker: Chrome Extension Project"></div></a></figure>
<p>Once installed, simply go to a page within the Cloudflare dashboard or Zero Trust dashboard, click on the extension, and copy the link. I would recommend testing the link first. At the time of writing, support for magic links in Zero Trust isn&apos;t complete, and some pages in the regular dashboard, like Workers, don&apos;t have full support for deep links. I hope to update the extension in the future, if wider support is added to the magic link system by the Cloudflare team.</p>

For small team and personal projects, uptime monitoring is often overlooked. Observability</p>
<p>Still, uptime monitoring is a valuable tool for incident response and tracking problems. If your servers go down at 2:00 AM on Saturday morning, it might be hard to catch unless you&apos;re a night owl like me. By the time you find out your critical service isn&apos;t functioning, it may be Monday or whenever customers or clients start sending support requests. That&apos;s no fun for anyone and makes it harder to gain visibility into what is broken.</p>
<p>That&apos;s where uptime monitoring tools come into play. A health check is run every few seconds or minutes to see if the server or endpoint is behaving as expected. The history of these checks and metrics on response speed is logged in a database for future review. If there&apos;s a problem, alarms or notifications can be triggered to ensure the right people know there&apos;s a problem as soon as it happens. </p>
<p>Tricities Media Group, my consultancy, is currently a single-person business, so I don&apos;t have a large team (or large budget) to configure enterprise monitoring solutions. But my client and my personal projects can still benefit from a comprehensive status monitoring system.</p>
<h2 id="my-solution">My Solution</h2>
<p>I decided upon a tool called Uptime Kuma, which is an open-source self-hosted monitoring tool that can be run with Docker. I&apos;m using Portainer on my Synology NAS to host the container and Cloudflare Zero Trust&apos;s Tunnels tool to securely expose it to the internet. This combo works great by using existing hardware that I already have running and allows for easy administration and maintenance. </p>
<p>Overall, I&apos;m super happy with how it&apos;s working and plan to expand my use of this tool in the future. This tool is open-source, MIT-licensed, and community-supported, so while there are a few potential cons, they are opportunities for improvement rather than complaints.</p>

<h2 id="pros-of-uptime-kuma">Pros of Uptime Kuma</h2>
<ul><li>So. many. notification. options. This screenshot only shows about a quarter of the options. From Discord and Slack to Twilio and PagerTree, there are few notification tools that I can think of that don&apos;t exist. If, for some odd reason, the one you use isn&apos;t there, it also supports Webhooks with a custom body and headers, letting you send a request pretty much anywhere.</li></ul>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://crtv.dev/content/images/2023/11/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Review of Uptime Kuma Self-hosted Status Monitoring Tool" loading="lazy" width="481" height="524"></figure>
<ul><li>There are lots of options for customizing health check requests. You can change the HTTP method, encoding, body, headers, and specify authentication (basic auth, OAuth2, NTLM, and mTLS). With that many options, there&apos;s few things you can&apos;t do. You could even use it for HTTP CRONs.</li><li>A variety of check types. In addition to standard HTTP request and ping checks, there&apos;s also support for TCP, DNS, and other Docker containers. Many of these options support response validation to check if expected results are returned. One handy feature is a push URL that your application calls every x seconds. On top of that, there&apos;s support for a variety of database and server types, such as Postgres, MySQL, Radius, and MQTT.</li><li>The biggest feature for me is integration with Cloudflare Tunnels for reverse proxy. It&apos;s as easy as pasting in the tunnel token.</li><li>Status pages let you create custom statuses with groups of services you select. This allows for creating a status page for each client, for each application, or one for all of your applications. The sky is the limit. In addition, you can pin custom error or warning messages to highlight incident statuses as you correct any issues.</li><li>Custom domains for status pages. You can create custom domains for your status pages allowing for a single instance of Uptime Kuma to handle a variety of products and services.</li><li>If you run the tool on-prem like I&apos;m doing in your home or office you can setup checks for systems on your local network. This let&apos;s you ping computers, security cameras, or anything really to see if they&apos;re running and awake. This opens a lot of options and the potential for using statuses as triggers for automation. For example, if all of the office computers are offline and it&apos;s after hours, schedule the lights to turn off in 5 minutes. Or if the smart refrigerator stops responding to health checks it may be worth checking in on. Just an idea. &#x1F914;</li></ul>
<h2 id="cons-of-uptime-kuma">Cons of Uptime Kuma</h2>
<ul><li>The base page of the app directs to login rather than a status page. For example, when a user visits <a href="https://status.tricitiesmediagroup.com/?ref=crtv.dev">https://status.tricitiesmediagroup.com/</a> you would expect to be taken to a status page, but instead, you&apos;re taken to the status page admin login. A great change would be the ability to set a default status page to live at the app&apos;s base. A potential workaround for this is to host your app at a different URL and use custom domains for your status pages. This one might just be user error, but I&apos;d appreciate the option either way.</li><li>Creating an incident isn&apos;t intuitive, especially at first. To create an incident message/update, you have to go to the status page&apos;s editor as if you were changing the page&apos;s title or style. A dedicated page within the main dashboard would be more intuitive and feel like a more seamless solution. </li><li>Lack of REST HTTP API. An API would superpower the capabilities of this project and make things like incidents much more programmable. Being able to send updates directly from an incident management system or form would help make automation much more seamless.</li><li>Automation integrations. This is probably something held back by not having an API, but it would be great to see integrations with tools like n8n or Zapier to trigger automation outside of the existing notification destinations. This can kinda be done using the webhooks feature, but still, there&apos;s an opportunity to let automation tools do things like set maintenance windows and incident messages.</li></ul>
<h2 id="resiliency-and-disaster-readiness">Resiliency and Disaster Readiness</h2>
<p>To wrap up, I have to add a quick note about resiliency. Many companies have made the mistake of hosting their uptime monitoring and error visibility tooling with the same infrastructure dependencies as the services they monitor. It&apos;s easy to see how this can go wrong. If there&apos;s a major problem and your systems go down, it&apos;s likely your uptime monitor will go down as well, making it useless.</p>
<p>For my purposes, I&apos;m self-hosting it locally and using Cloudflare as the tunneling service. I, of course, do not host any of my services or sites locally, so as far as ISP, server, power, and network resiliency go, I should be fairly good. But I do use Cloudflare extensively. If Cloudflare&apos;s DNS or Tunneling went down, my entire infrastructure would be taken out. There are always going to be risks, but it&apos;s important to identify those risks and consider them when planning a solution. For my purposes, that&apos;s within my acceptable tolerance of risk, so I&apos;m not going to spend the resources required to go a different route. If you&apos;re a large company or a dependency in your infrastructure is less reliable or more critical, I would suggest getting as much separation as possible between your core application services and your uptime solution. (read: Host on a different continent, use a different DNS, a different domain name registrar, and use an alternative payment method to pay for it)</p>

By definition, those who are paid hourly get paid based on how many hours they work. (Indeed, 2023) It seems like a simple concept. But as information technology professionals, most of what we do involves making systems and processes more efficient. </p>
<p>But what does that mean if we&apos;re paid hourly? </p>
<p>Even if it might not seem that way, there is a finite amount of IT work that an organization can realistically need. So, by creating more efficient systems and processes, we&apos;re effectively reducing our earning potential even though we&apos;re adding value to the organization.&#xA0;</p>
<blockquote>There are downsides to being salaried as well, where a reduction of overall headcount may occur instead of a reduction of hours.</blockquote>
<p>Diving deeper, hourly billing is rooted in the Labor Theory of Value, a foundation of Marxism, where the value of labor is emphasized in the production process and ideal distribution of wealth. (Taylor, 1996) The idea that a worker&apos;s time is valuable is popularized by workers who argue they should be compensated based on how much time they spend working rather than the value they provide. This is where the concepts of minimum wages and pay ceilings come from. An example would be saying, &quot;Workers who work 60 hours per week should make more per year than those who work 40 hours because the 60-hour worker works harder.&quot;</p>

<p>By being a truly effective IT professional by providing the maximum value to your employer or client, you&apos;re optimizing yourself out of a job. So what&apos;s the alternative? Make things more complicated? Here are a few approaches that are taken:</p>
<ul><li>Put effort into developing complex and hard-to-understand policies, procedures, and guidelines to ensure that bureaucracy slows down the organization and increases the amount of required labor.</li><li>Increase the barrier of entry by requiring additional qualifications, certifications, government-mandated licenses, and other means to reduce and limit the talent pool.</li><li>Avoid tools that make us more efficient, such as modern IDEs (integrated development environments) and <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot?ref=crtv.dev">GitHub Copilot</a> (AI code autocomplete).</li><li>Unionize to pressure employers to let us increase the amount of time we spend by limiting change and innovation to protect union member jobs while increasing benefits and compensation.&#xA0;</li></ul>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgflip.com%2F1efqtj.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=7d206e3dfa924505d4c62ef8504d60b2684f8647db89654e239ab02e6b9ad026&amp;ipo=images" class="kg-image" alt="The Ethics of Hourly Billing" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>via imgflip</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of those options are commonly taken (not just in IT), but are they ethical? That question is answered based on your personal opinions and economic ideas. An alternative could be to incentivize employees to create value in a way that attempts to minimize the disincentivizing nature of increased efficiency and automation, but there are few mainstream examples of that within IT.</p>
<p>So that brings us to the title of this article: The Ethics of Hourly Billing</p>
<p>If employees aren&apos;t incentivized to be good at their jobs, that raises the question of how employees can behave ethically. I&apos;m of the persuasion that people never behave counter to their incentives, so to create an ethical workforce, hourly compensation can&apos;t be the sole motivator. </p>
<p>A few types of employees may include:</p>
<ul><li>Employees who see it as their moral duty to society to do their best at their jobs. </li><li>Those who simply do not consider the true economic incentives associated with their job. </li></ul>
<p>Most people probably fall within these two categories rather than maliciously sabotaging their workplace but likely do participate in activities that ensure their job security without even realizing it.</p>
<p>The traditional solution to this problem in the tech startup world is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp?ref=crtv.dev">stock options</a> mirroring the long-standing practice of incentivizing executives by getting stock and/or full equity. When employees can earn favorable stock options, restricted stock, phantom stock, etc. they&apos;re given an opportunity to invest in their efforts and hopefully benefit from the profits of the company. But this doesn&apos;t necessarily make sense for every company (especially for small companies and those owned privately).</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4B0;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Startups are often messy. Sometimes the incentive to build a company up enough to be able to get an exit payday results in a sacrifice in quality control and security that ultimately hurts the startup&apos;s growth. Just giving employees stock probably isn&apos;t the answer either because that just incentivizes employees to work towards raising the company&apos;s valuation, which doesn&apos;t necessarily equal true business success.</div></div>
<p>So, what&apos;s the best solution to this ethical dilemma? I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s clear that employees whose roles are to minimize inefficiencies and to effectively automate their own jobs (and the jobs of others) aren&apos;t incentivized to act in the best interest of their company causing an ethics conflict. But it&apos;s not clear the best way to universally fix this issue. And complex hard-to-understand questions like this are why economists have job security. &#x1F609;&#x1F602;</p>

<p>If you&apos;d like to read more on this topic, I wrote another post on hourly billing and labor theories over on The Church Factory, where I take a look at the similarities between traditional hourly billing and value-based pricing. Surprisingly, there are similarities, but also big differences. </p>

<p>As a prerequisite, let&apos;s take a quick moment to look at three different Cloudflare terms that will be important: Zones, Profiles, and Accounts. If someone asks for access to your Cloudflare account, they&apos;re not asking for your username and password, instead, they&apos;re asking you to create a profile for them within your account.</p>
<p><strong>Zones</strong><br>A zone is most closely related to a domain but not to be confused with a website. Your Zones can be found within the homepage of the Cloudflare dashboard and serve as the hub for everything related to a domain using Cloudflare. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I disagree. <br><br>Websites have been called zones in the APIs and other places for as long as I remember so relabeling in the dashboard lowers confusion.<br><br>In addition a zone in cloudflare doesn&apos;t represent a website.

<p><strong>Profiles</strong><br>If you&apos;re reading this post, you&apos;re probably looking to add a profile to your account. Profiles are individual user logins attached to a single person and should never be shared between team members. A user&apos;s profile is tied directly to them and their email address. Profiles have a one-to-many relationship with accounts because a single profile can have access to multiple Cloudflare accounts, which in turn can give a profile access to many different zones.</p>

<p><strong>Accounts</strong><br>Accounts serve as a container for all of your organization&apos;s Cloudflare resources. Accounts hold all your Zones, Workers, Page, D1 databases, etc. One account can have many different profile members, each with their own roles and permissions.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-members-page">Step 1: Members Page</h3>
<p>First, log into your Cloudflare account. Then from the Cloudflare home dashboard, navigate to the side panel and select &#x201C;Members&#x201D; from within the &#x201C;Manage Account&#x201D; sub-menu.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-invite-a-new-member">Step 2: Invite a New Member</h3>
<p>From the manage account &quot;Members&quot; page, press the invite button or edit an existing member.</p>
<p>If you haven&apos;t already, now it a great time to enable &quot;Member 2FA enforcement&quot; to ensure that all of your users have a 2FA method enabled.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-configure-account-privileges">Step 3: Configure Account Privileges</h3>
<p>From the invite page, first, enter the email address for your new user(s). Then within the scope section, select either &quot;include&quot; or &quot;exclude&quot; for your scope rule operator. Next, under &quot;Type&quot;, select between:</p>
<ul><li><strong>All domains:</strong> Gives the user access to all domains (aka zones) on the account. This option is required to give the user access to account-level resources such as R2, Pages, Workers, Images, etc.</li><li><strong>A specific domain:</strong> Select a single domain (or zone) to give the user access to. (You can add multiple zones by adding a rule for each).</li><li><strong>Domain group:</strong> Select a predefined group of domains (zones).</li></ul>
<div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>What is a zone?</strong></b><br><span>In Cloudflare, a DNS Zone is a single domain name. </span><br><span>- These would be in the same zone: example.com, blog.example.com, and example.com/about </span><br><span>- These would be in separate zones: example.com, example.co, example.co.uk</span></p></div></div>
<p>After selecting the scope for the user, you can now configure the domain-scoped rules. These permissions allow you to control the new user&apos;s access level. For example, you may want only to grant read access. Always follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege?ref=crtv.dev">principle of least privilege</a> when assigning access. Once permissions are selected, press &#x201C;Continue to summary.&#x201D; Confirm the options are correct, and finally send the invite.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://crtv.dev/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to add users to a Cloudflare account" loading="lazy" width="963" height="933" srcset="https://crtv.dev/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, https://crtv.dev/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png 963w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Now your new user will receive an invite email allowing them to join your Cloudflare account. If you ever need to change privileges or remove users, you can return to the &quot;Members&quot; submenu item under &quot;Manage Account.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design Systems]]></title><description><![CDATA[What are design systems, and how do they benefit the software development lifecycle?]]></description><link>https://crtv.dev/design-systems/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64cf1e48f4100cf408f0f4d9</guid><category><![CDATA[Design]]></category><category><![CDATA[UI/UX]]></category><category><![CDATA[Systems Analysis]]></category><category><![CDATA[Project Management]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mackenly Jones]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 04:21:49 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1626544827763-d516dce335e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHNoYXBlfGVufDB8fHx8MTY5MTI5NTQ2N3ww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-are-design-systems"><strong>What are design systems?</strong></h3>

As a whole, a design system enables users throughout an organization to create applications, creatives, and other design elements in a way that matches and feels cohesive.</p>

<h3 id="sdlc-benefits"><strong>SDLC Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>Design systems are about more than which colors and fonts to use. Design systems enable apps to become a part of an ecosystem. If your organization has a design system or follows another company&apos;s design system, it will be easy for users of your system to pick up your app&apos;s interface quickly. When components and layouts look the same across systems, users can bring their familiarity with them even when they&apos;ve never used your new application.</p>
<h3 id="spillover-benefits"><strong>Spillover Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to useability advantages, design systems also simplify the app design process, make building wireframes a breeze, and streamline the development process. Developers following a design system only have to implement components once. They can use your organization&apos;s component library across various apps, reducing repeated UI code and speeding up the development process.</p>

<p>Social engineering is one of the oldest forms of malicious or unethical hacking. Scammers and con artists have used social engineering long before computers and the internet were ever created. The first social engineering attack comes from the story or legend of the Trojan Horse. According to legend, the Greeks hid inside a wooden horse and tricked the Trojans into letting them into the gated city.</p>

<p>Another example of social engineering is the well-known Nigerian Prince email scam. You may think that the seemingly obvious scam is a new invention that came about because of low-cost email sending (cast a wide net, eh?), but that isn&apos;t the case. The Nigerian Prince scam traces its roots as far back as the 1800s when it was known as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/charles-seife-writes-about-the-origin-of-the-spanish-prisoner-scam-2014-7?ref=crtv.dev">Spanish Prisoner scam</a>.</p>

<p>All throughout history, humans have been trying to trick, manipulate, and take advantage of one another. The recent phenomena of internet-based social engineering attacks is merely a chapter in social engineering&apos;s long history. As ethical hackers, our role is not to trick people maliciously but to educate and train our coworkers and clients to identify malicious actors who use their psychological knowledge to further their own interests.</p>
<p>Scammers, hackers, and con artists have used social engineering for millennia, and the general idea hasn&apos;t changed much, but the actual implementations of the attacks are always evolving to take advantage of emerging technologies and to outpace the public&apos;s awareness of tactics. Here are two current examples of age-old attacks that are being updated with modern tech:</p>
<h3 id="new-phishing-domain-names">New Phishing Domain Names</h3>
<p>The #1 type of social engineering attack is phishing. Phishing comes in many forms (such as spam emails), but a recent threat has emerged that will likely be a headache for cyber security professionals who try to educate their coworkers on identifying phishing attacks. This new threat is the creation of the .zip and .mov TLD (top-level domains) by Google, which means anyone can register domain names using this extension. I share <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1657165035326566407?ref=crtv.dev">SwiftOnSecurity</a>, a popular cyber security Twitter commentator&apos;s, sentiment in calling this move &quot;dumb.&quot;</p>
<p>Let&apos;s look at an example of how this could be exploited in this infographic from Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/hnasr/status/1658853944037351424?ref=crtv.dev">@hnasr</a>:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is the difference between the two urls? <br>one has an @ and one doesn&apos;t.<br><br>But also the first downloads version 15 of postgres from GitHub and the second one resolves to v15 dot zip domain which can also downloads a zip file that sure doesn&apos;t have postgres in it.<br> <br>You see,&#x2026; <a href="https://t.co/muGU1ruYdD?ref=crtv.dev">pic.twitter.com/muGU1ruYdD</a></p>&#x2014; Hussein Nasser (@hnasr) <a href="https://twitter.com/hnasr/status/1658853944037351424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=crtv.dev">May 17, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></figure>
<p>These new domains will make it even easier to hackers to create realistic-looking phishing URLs.</p>
<h3 id="vishing">Vishing</h3>
<p>Vishing is a term assigned to phishing-style attacks conducted on the phone using the attacker&apos;s voice.</p>
<p>Most people are fairly alert when it comes to random spam calls; however, when combined with information gained from reconnaissance, sophisticated attackers can be very believable. When used in combination with another attack adding a phone call into the mix can add credibility to an otherwise suspicious attack by making it seem more genuine rather than just a bot.</p>
<p>If you&apos;ve been keeping up with tech news as of late, you&apos;ve probably seen demos where a clip of someone speaking is fed into an AI-powered tool, and the user gets a custom text-to-speech tool. This is great for attackers. With enough digging, you can find a video of most people (especially well-known business people) on social media. If you want to go full James Bond, you could even directly obtain audio recordings. All you&apos;ve got to do is get audio clips (doesn&apos;t matter how), and you can create a fake voice that sounds exactly like an authority figure which you could use to manipulate a subordinate into transferring money or other action via a vishing call. This kind of thing used to only live in the imaginations of movie and TV writers, but it&apos;s now a reality.</p>
<p>An interesting <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/vishing-attacks-on-the-hph-sector-analyst-note.pdf?ref=crtv.dev">report published by the US HHS&apos;s Office of Information Security</a> claims a form of vishing called &quot;hybrid vishing&quot; increased by 625% in Q2 of 2022. A hybrid vishing attack is typically characterized by a multistage vishing process where the attacker calls back or introduces other stages to their attack.</p>
<p>One common variation is where the attacker sends a phishing email that instructs the victim to call a number. Adding a phone call increases the perceived legitimacy of the email, making victims feel more comfortable with the attacker. From my own personal experiences, I know I&apos;ve seen many companies say that they will never ask for passwords over the phone, but they obviously do ask for them through websites. If I get a call asking me to verify by opening a link sent to my email and to check my spam, I might feel comfortable enough to do it since that&apos;s an authentication method deployed by many legitimate companies.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Think of it like this. Both malicious hackers and ethical hackers follow a similar strategy for successfully meeting their objectives. To defend a system, cyber security professionals rely on a concept called &quot;layered defense,&quot; where multiple security controls or defenses are layered on top of each other so that even if one fails or is breached, the overall system isn&apos;t completely exposed. Attackers can utilize the same concept by implementing a &quot;layered attack&quot; where multiple steps are combined to increase the chances of success. Just sending a phishing email or just making a vishing call isn&apos;t likely to succeed. But when combined into a hybrid vishing attack, the attacker has a much greater chance of success. </p>
<p>Just like a single attack is more likely to fail, so is a single defense. Defense strategies with single points of failure (while sometimes hard to avoid) are likely to eventually be breached. As information technology professionals, it&apos;s our job to identify weak points in the systems we design and develop so that we can add multiple layers of security between our protected assets and attack surfaces.</p>
<p>Social engineering attacks are as old as dirt, but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re unstoppable. Using multiple layers of defenses and ensuring accountability is maintained helps mitigate the threat of social engineering to an organization. Like all cyber security threats, your organization will never be 100% safe, but investing resources and training into improving your odds could mean the difference between disaster and identifying an attack before it succeeds.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Wayback Machine]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In an ever-evolving digital world, websites come and go, often taking valuable information with them.

The Wayback Machine, a digital web page archive created by the Internet Archive, seeks to preserve these moments in time for future generations to get a snapshot into the past.</p>
<p>Regularly used by journalists, researchers, and even web developers (to see the history of pages), the Wayback Machine has become an increasingly valuable tool for time traveling through the internet.</p>
<p>The Wayback Machine works by crawling websites, following links, and saving the content the crawler finds. The site boasts of having over 805 billion web pages archived.</p>
<p>The data archived by the Wayback Machine can be very useful for cyber security professionals, black hat hackers, and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gatherers. As a developer, there are several potential dangers of your website being achieved:</p>
<ul><li>Comments in the code revealing sensitive data could expose your company to attack</li><li>Contact information on the site could be used in phishing attacks</li><li>Blog posts or other public content could reveal sensitive information about your organization&apos;s policies and procedures</li></ul>
<p>Even though the Wayback Machine does present a security challenge, the Internet Archive&apos;s important mission of preserving the web for future generations benefits everyone. It&apos;s important to be aware of the fact that anything posted to the internet is probably archived somewhere. Cyber security specialists can help educate and inform their community, employers, and clients of the importance of not sharing potentially compromising information publicly on the web by knowing about and understanding tools like the Wayback Machine.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-developers-utilize-the-wayback-machine">How can developers utilize the Wayback Machine?</h3>
<p>If you work with clients or are on a dysfunctional team you may be familiar with stories like this... &quot;Our website is down because our hosting server got deleted and we don&apos;t have backups!&quot; This issue could be caused by someone not paying the bill, a malicious threat actor, or an incompetent employee. Either way, it&apos;s your responsibility to fix it.</p>
<p>Without a live website to restore or access the actual data on the servers, your options are limited. You might have never even visited the website you&apos;re trying to recover. This is where Wayback comes in. Using the Wayback Machine you can look back in time and see archived versions of the site, hopefully enabling you to rebuild the site. Not a great resolution, but without Wayback you would have had to start 100% from scratch.</p>
<p>Another common use case for Wayback is Always Online tools. Cloudflare in particular, has a feature powered by the Wayback Machine that enables their customers to opt into an Always Online feature. When your site&apos;s server is offline or otherwise unreachable, an archived version of your site is shown to your users with a little banner that lets them know this is an archived version. This feature is invaluable during downtime or other cases where your server may be offline. This is all thanks to the efforts of the Internet Archive and the contributors to the Wayback Machine.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-protect-myself-from-the-potential-security-vulnerabilities-associated-with-the-wayback-machine">How can I protect myself from the potential security vulnerabilities associated with the Wayback Machine?</h3>
<p>Wayback in and of itself isn&apos;t a malicious or otherwise harmful service. In fact, as the previous section discussed, Wayback can be valuable to developers and IT professionals. The issues arise when site owners carelessly expose sensitive information that could be used by malicious threat actors to build out a target profile or as clues to conduct better-informed attacks.</p>
<p>Information security is paramount when it comes to the internet because any number of actors are constantly scraping the internet and saving what they find. Search engines like Google do this to provide better search results, the Wayback Machine does this to compile an internet library, and well-funded malicious actors such as nation-states and organized crime groups may be scraping the internet to gather intelligence and leverage. Because of these reasons, it must not be forgotten that anything you post on the internet might as well be published on the front page of every newspaper in the world and memorialized in lights on every billboard from Time Square in New York to Moscow, Russia and everywhere in between.</p>
<h3 id="what-policies-can-my-organization-implement-to-minimize-the-threat-of-scrapping-archives">What policies can my organization implement to minimize the threat of scrapping archives?</h3>
<p>Every organization&apos;s information security policies should dictate the importance of ensuring confidential data stays confidential. A few helpful ideas include:</p>
<ul><li>Utilize secret scanning tools like GitHub&apos;s code scanning features with push protection: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning?ref=crtv.dev">https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning</a></li><li>Don&apos;t publically expose internal documentation and resources/tooling.</li><li> Require peer code reviews and ensure that secure programming practices are followed.</li><li>Avoid disclosure of confidential information or specific technologies in job postings. Rather than saying we use WordPress version 2.0 and MySQL say we use CMSs like WordPress, Sanity, Druple, and Contentful along with database technologies like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.</li><li>Never put personal employee contact details on your website.</li><li>Restrict employees from disclosing confidential information about the internals of your systems in interviews, podcasts, engineering articles, etc.</li><li>Utilize a tool or build step that removes comments from your code. It&apos;s a great practice to write descriptive comments in your code, but it&apos;s not a great practice to share those comments with an attacker attempting to reverse engineer your site.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Choosing the Right Java Data Types]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>There are several reasons for Java having different data types.

Java has eight primitive data types: </p>
<ul><li>byte</li><li>short</li><li>int</li><li>long</li><li>float</li><li>double</li><li>char</li><li>boolean</li></ul>
<p>Of those eight, six are used to represent numbers. Byte, short, int, and long are all used to represent integers, while float and double are used to represent floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>You may be asking, &quot;Why do we need to memorize six different data types just to store numbers?&quot; Well, here are a few reasons:</p>
<h3 id="size-performance">Size / Performance</h3>
<p>Primitive data types store their values directly in the memory location that&apos;s allocated for them. As a result, primitive data types have a fixed memory size. An int will always and only take up 4 bytes (32 bits) regardless of its value. The number 7 can be represented in the smallest Java data type, which is a byte (8 bits), or it can be represented as an int which is 4 bytes (32 bits).</p>
<ul><li>Seven as a byte: 00000111</li><li>Seven as an int: 00000000000000000000000000000111</li></ul>
<p>On most modern computers with hefty amounts of RAM, most programmers might not think they have to worry about how much memory their programs consume. After all, unless you&apos;re doing embedded systems programming where memory is limited, storing someone&apos;s age as an int rather than byte or short isn&apos;t going to cause your program to crash. But if your program is storing or processing a billion people&apos;s age, that&apos;s a different story. I&apos;ve heard many stories where developers choose the wrong data type, resulting in unnecessary costs or performance issues for their applications. At scale, consuming four times the necessary memory or storage has real performance implications and can cost your organization millions of dollars. This is the key reason for needing so many data types. Only using what you need means there&apos;s less data for the computer to process and less data being stored in memory, files, and databases.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/cjg0kvnAC5oAAAAC/download.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Choosing the Right Java Data Types" loading="lazy" width="498" height="264"></figure>
<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>
<p>The other major reason is precision. This is inherently a side effect of saving space by selecting smaller data types. If you use a data type that&apos;s smaller, by definition, it can hold less data. This can become an issue when accuracy and precision are important when you don&apos;t know ahead of time how large of a value you need to store. According to our textbook, Doubles can hold up to 14 or 15 significant digits, while Float holds up to 6 or 7 significant digits. If you attempt to assign the value 3.1415926535 to a float, you&apos;re going to be out of luck. Java will truncate the value to 3.1415927 and your IDE will scream at you. Java gives us multiple data types so that we can select the best type for the data we&apos;re storing, but it&apos;s up to us as programmers to know what each type can hold and which will work best for our use case.</p>
<h3 id="type-capacity-bonus">Type Capacity (Bonus)</h3>
<p>Different data types can, of course, hold different maximum and minimum values. But one additional thing to consider is why can a short hold -32,768 to 32,767 rather than -32,768 to 32,768? Since data is stored in binary (which is a base-two number system), it would seem to make sense that the max number would be divisible by two. But that doesn&apos;t take into account zero.</p>
<p>Two bytes (the size of a short) contains 16 bits. With signed binary, that means there&apos;s a total of 15 bits that can be used to represent numbers (one is used to switch positive/negative). A total of 32,768 values are being stored within those 15 bits, whether positive or negative. However, there&apos;s one less positive number because with a positive number, all zeros mean zero; with a negative number, all zeros mean the lowest possible number. Positive numbers have to give up one value to be able to represent zero.</p>
<p>With any length of bits, the maximum number of values that can be represented is always divisible by two, but that doesn&apos;t mean what the values represent always will be since zero must be counted as a possible value.</p>

Procedural programming languages include ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, and C, while a few well-known object-oriented languages include C#, Python, C++, Java, PHP, Scala, and Perl.</p>
<p>Procedural programming languages are very linear in nature. Let&apos;s think of it like this. You want to bake a cake mix.</p>
<ol><li>First, you preheat the oven.</li><li>Then, you mix the ingredients for the cake in a certain order: first the dry ingredients, then the wet ones.</li><li>Next, you pour the batter into a baking pan.</li><li>After that, you place the pan into the oven.</li><li>Finally, you allow the cake to bake for a specified amount of time, then remove it from the oven to cool.</li></ol>
<p>Much like the steps of making a cake, in a procedural program, all the program&apos;s steps have to be executed in order. Now let&apos;s think about object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP has three main concepts:</p>
<ul><li>Blueprints for objects called classes</li><li>Instances of the classes called objects</li><li>Applications or programs that manipulate or use the objects</li></ul>
<p>It can be a challenge to master without experimentation, but for the sake of this post, let&apos;s go back to the cake example being made at a bakery rather than your kitchen. Instead of a simple todo-list, the bakery staff has devised a system to make baking cakes easy and fast.</p>
<ol><li>At this bakery, there are different types of cakes you might want to bake: a vanilla cake, a chocolate cake, a carrot cake, etc. Each of these types of cakes can be considered a &quot;class.&quot; They all share certain characteristics that they inherit from a Cake class (they all need to be baked, they all require some form of flour, sugar, eggs, etc.), but each also has unique attributes (vanilla cake uses vanilla extract, chocolate cake uses cocoa, etc.).</li><li>When you decide to bake a specific cake, say a chocolate cake, you&apos;re creating an &quot;object&quot; or an &quot;instance&quot; of the chocolate cake class, which extends the Cake class. This specific cake that you&apos;re baking will have all the attributes of a chocolate cake, but also inherits from the Cake class that it extends.</li><li>When you&apos;re running a bakery, you also have other classes of objects that interact with the cakes. For instance, you might have an &quot;Oven&quot; class, which can accept any cake, because all cakes share the &quot;Bakeable&quot; characteristic. You can create specific Oven instances, like a convection oven or a traditional oven, each with its own attributes and methods.</li><li>You can even have a &quot;Baker&quot; class. The Baker objects have methods like &quot;MixIngredients&quot; or &quot;DecorateCake.&quot; These methods can be used on any cake object, because again, all cakes share certain characteristics.</li></ol>
<p>As you can see, this gets complicated super fast, but most computer programming projects are very complicated. Many new programmers will use scripting languages that allow the use of procedural-style programming, and that&apos;s fine for simple programs, but as your project&apos;s complexity scales, so does your program&apos;s complexity. One of the best use cases for OOP is when you&apos;re trying to simulate real-world ideas, things, and concepts on a computer. Even though OOP typically results in more boilerplate code, it makes it easier long term and allows programmers to better organize their code. Verbosity and specificity are a programmer&apos;s best friends.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-oop-be-used-in-the-real-world">How can OOP be used in the real world?</h3>
<p>OOP emphasizes reusability, encapsulation, and inheritance making OOP a compelling choice for managing complex coding projects.</p>
<p>Never repeating yourself is a great rule to live by when coding. In some cases, it would seem that simply creating methods/functions would provide the same benefit of reusability as classes/objects. However, I think the true superpower of an object is being able to store state within the object&apos;s attributes.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I had a project where I needed to perform an ETL (extract transform load) process where, at a high level, I imported an export from Stripe (a payment processor), added some data from a Stripe API endpoint, and then exported the data into a format that another payment processor could import. This had to be custom because no other solutions existed, and some of the Stripe data was only accessible through their API, not their exports, likely in an attempt to lock you in. The way I did it was to create a class for the items I was processing that stored all of the item&apos;s data in attributes using the constructor. I then added methods that could be called to interact with the data using the data stored in the object&apos;s attributes. The benefit is that I could call objectt1.doThingy() without having to worry about making sure I&apos;m passing in the right parameters. Because I have an instance of my class called object1, all I have to do is call the method, and the method knows where to get the correct data.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Java "new" Keyword and Constructors]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The &quot;new&quot; keyword is used to allocate memory and instantiate a reference data type.

Primitive data types include byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char. Reference data types are other data types that point to or reference other memory locations. They can include Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, Strings, Enumerations, and Annotations.</p>
<p>This illustration from CS@ME does a great job explaining what that actually looks like:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://king.instructure.com/users/11006/files/2509938/preview?verifier=CsybTsflx95eehXcOYTwcbpcYcJEhYy5Znkfbwiv" class="kg-image" alt="Java &quot;new&quot; Keyword and Constructors" loading="lazy" width="328" height="154"></figure>
<p>When the &quot;new&quot; keyword is used alongside a class&apos; constructor, a new instance of the class called an object is instantiated. This is because of the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming. This principle states that the internal state of an object should only be modified through its methods, and direct access to or modification of its fields should be avoided. By forcing the use of the new keyword to call constructors, Java ensures that objects are properly initialized before they&apos;re used and that their internal state is protected.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-overview-of-constructors">A quick overview of constructors</h3>
<p>A constructor&apos;s purpose is to establish an object&apos;s initial state, differentiating it from other standard methods, thanks to certain specific rules.</p>
<p>Diving deeper, it&apos;s also worth mentioning that constructors can be overloaded, similar to regular methods. This means we can have multiple constructors in a class, each with a different parameter list and method signature. This enables more flexibility in initializing an object&apos;s state.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Test {
  private int var1;
  private int var2;

  public Test(int var1, int var2) {
    this.var1 = var1;
    this.var2 = var2;
  }

  public Test() {
    this.var1 = 0;
    this.var2 = 0;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Using overloading, programmers can create multiple constructors for their classes. This technique, called constructor overloading, allows programmers to design their classes to be more flexible. You typically want to use a constructor to pass in any required parameters when you instantiate a class as an object. Objects should represent things within your program and ideally should accurately represent that thing as soon as you instantiate it. You can then use setters and other methods to change that state as needed as the state of the object needs to change. In an ideal world, throughout the entire lifecycle of your program, any objects and variables in scope should be the best representation of their current value. Having variables and objects with meaningless values could result in other programmers using them when their true values haven&apos;t been set. Using parameterized constructors, programmers can pass in meaningful values to describe the object&apos;s initial state.</p>
<p>Another important constructor feature is the &apos;this&apos; keyword. &apos;This&apos; refers to the current object &#x2014; the object whose constructor is being called. It can be used to access the class fields or to call other constructors within the same class. A use case is if you have a variable in your constructor called var1, but one of the class instance variables is also called var1. If you use var1, it will point to the constructor&apos;s variable, but if you use this.var1, it will point to the instance variable. </p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">class Test {
  private int var1;
  private int var2;
  
  public Test(int var1, int var2) {
    this.var1 = var1;
    this.var2 = var2;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Often you&apos;ll want to name your parameters for your constructor the same as the instance variables in the class. Using &quot;this&quot; enables you to do that without conflict.</p>
<p>Another important note is that the Java compiler automatically creates a default constructor if we don&apos;t explicitly define any constructor in a class. Most programmers choose to create their own default constructor, though, because rarely do you want to use the default values.</p>
<h3 id="when-is-new-not-required">When is &quot;new&quot; not required?</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may want to create a class full of static methods. Often if you have several methods that you need to use throughout your project, you may put these methods into a utility class. Since the utility class itself is just a collection of commonly used methods, we can assume three things:</p>
<ol><li>The name of the class is irrelevant, with no semantic meaning. (ex: utils, tools, etc.)</li><li>The methods are not related in any way other than being commonly used throughout the app.</li><li>No state needs to be stored in instance variables/attributes because the methods aren&apos;t related. Therefore, no constructor is required.</li></ol>
<p>Based on those assumptions, we can fill our class with static methods. Static methods are methods that can be called directly without using the new keyword to instantiate an object. Here&apos;s an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">// Usage:
Utils.printer(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);

// Implementation:
public static void printer(String str) {
  System.out.println(str);
} // end printer</code></pre>
<p>With our utils class, we don&apos;t get any of the benefits of storing an object&apos;s state because we do not have to create a new object. This saves memory and results in cleaner code. If we needed to store attributes within an object, this option wouldn&apos;t work because we need a constructor instantiated using the &quot;new&quot; keyword to create a memory reference to store our state.</p>
<p>In summary, the &quot;new&quot; operator is required to create an object of a reference type and literally means, &quot;Hey Java, create a new place in memory to point to this thing I&apos;m constructing.&quot; If you try to call a constructor without the &quot;new&quot; keyword, Java will interpret your constructor as a method, not a constructor, and it will try to call a method named the same as your constructor, which does not exist, resulting in a compilation error.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Storing Money in Java (and other languages)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I was reading a book about Java and it had this practice question at the end of a chapter:</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve studied much about Java you&apos;ll probably realize what&apos;s wrong here, so feel free to share it as a meme. But if not, this is a great learning opportunity. </p>
<p>TL;DR Java has floats and doubles as primitives (doubles hold more), but they both can result in rounding errors when working with fractional amounts. So using either for money or anything else important is a cardinal sin in Java. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://crtv.dev/content/images/2023/07/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Storing Money in Java (and other languages)" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1218" srcset="https://crtv.dev/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-3.png 600w, https://crtv.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-3.png 1000w, https://crtv.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-3.png 1600w, https://crtv.dev/content/images/2023/07/image-3.png 2371w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>It&apos;s the same concept as the fraction 1/3 in base-10 where you get 0.3333[...] . Nothing is ever priced 1/3 of a dollar because we can&apos;t do that with money (which is base-10). </p>
<p>The problem comes in with base-2 because the prime numbers that cause the &quot;glitches&quot; are different. If you&apos;ve studied how computers work on a low level or have just seen the matrix, you may know that computers on their lowest level store data as true and false or better known as 1 and 0.</p>
<p>This true and false data is known as binary which is a base-2 number system (0-1). Humans commonly use decimal (0-9) which is base-10. One of the first things we learn in school when we start learning division is called prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than one and only divisible by themselves (without a remainder). Base-10 primes include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. These prime numbers become a problem later in school when we&apos;re taught how that the fraction 1/3 in base-10 is a continuous sequence of 3s. In school, we typically cheat by rounding.</p>
<p>The math behind it is that 10&apos;s prime factors are 2 and 5, which means that in decimal, any fraction where the denominator is a power of 2 or 5 can be exactly represented in decimal. Binary is similar, but 2&apos;s only prime factor is 2. That means in base-2, only fractions where the denominator is a power of 2 can be exactly represented. One tenth (0.1) in base-10, when converted to base-2, results in a problem because it, like 1/3 in decimal, results in an endless repeating fraction. Computers, like humans, don&apos;t have infinite memory, so they are designed to do just like we learned to do grade school, they round.</p>

<p>That means that things that make perfect sense with money like buying ten $0.10 candies breaks when represented using a computer (which uses base-2).</p>
<p>To illustrate I&apos;ve made a quick demo program in Java. Starting at 0, if we add 0.1 ten times, we end up with 0.9999999999999999[...]</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1035359555686760579/1117664577216315483/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Storing Money in Java (and other languages)" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>I never enjoyed math in school, but that doesn&apos;t seem right. Ten dimes should indeed equal one whole dollar. &#x1F4B5;</p>
<p>The solution is typically to either multiply/divide by 100 so that all money is in cents (whole numbers) or using a class called BigDecimal which has more controls for working with decimals. Both options effectively eliminate any challenges with storing money. Some APIs and tools go as far as using cents from the start. Stripe, for example, requires developers to send prices in cents. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/create?ref=crtv.dev#"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Stripe API reference &#x2013; Create a price &#x2013; curl</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Complete reference documentation for the Stripe API.

<p>So now that you know that storing money in a double is bad you too can enjoy memes about money data types.</p>

However, when creating logical expressions, we as humans rarely only use NAND gates. Instead, we write our logic in easier-to-think-of gates/functions such as AND, OR, and NOT and let the computer abstract away our expressions into NAND gates for the hardware. Much in the same way, Java provides programmers with extra loops that abstract the functionality giving us keywords that are easier to write and understand.</p>

<p>The three common loop types are:</p>
<h3 id="while-loop">While Loop: </h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, this loop can be used for any use case where you&apos;d want to use a loop. While loops are often paired with a boolean variable that acts as a flag, but can directly evaluate boolean expressions in their condition.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">// do while example
boolean condition = false;
do {
  System.out.println(&quot;This is a do while loop&quot;);
} while (condition);

// Outputs:
This is a do while loop</code></pre>
<h3 id="for-loop">For Loop:</h3>
<p>Often, the first loop programmers learn, this loop is great for doing something a certain number of times while giving the programmer access to the current iteration/index number. Notice the use of the index value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">// for loop example
for (int i
  System. out. print &quot;1 IS
} // end for loop

// Output:
i is: 0
i is: 1
i is: 2
i is: 3
i is: 4
i is: 5
i is: 6
i is: 7
i is: 8
i is: 9</code></pre>
<h3 id="do-while-loop">Do-while Loop:</h3>
<p>Pretty much the same as a while loop, but the code will execute once before evaluating the condition. Only subsequent iterations are based on the condition&apos;s result. Notice that the condition is false, but it still printed once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">// while loop flag example
boolean flag = true;
int count = 0;
while (flag) {
  System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
  count++;
  if (count == 10) {
    flag = false;
  }
}

// Output:
Hello World</code></pre>
<p>If someone were to argue that it&apos;s pointless to have multiple types of loops when you can do it all with a while loop, I would ask why are they using Java when they could be writing in assembly or even full-on binary if they&apos;re a true believer. Programming is all about abstraction. Programming languages are there to make writing code easier and more human-friendly, so adding syntax features that lower the programmer&apos;s cognitive load should be the goal of any language.</p>
<p>Furthermore, selecting the correct loop construct goes beyond syntax and code brevity considerations. It is also a way of expressing the developer&apos;s intent more meaningfully. A &quot;for&quot; loop typically indicates a known number of iterations, whereas &quot;while&quot; and &quot;do-while&quot; loops suggest a loop duration that is contingent upon a certain condition being met. This clarity of intent is crucial for code maintainability and interpretability. You could convert all loops to &quot;while&quot; loops, but the loss of semantic clarity and simplicity might outweigh the minimal space saved.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Algorithms vs. Cake Mixes]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Cooking is a great source of example algorithms and serves as a great stand-in for learning how to code.</p>

<p>One of my first programming instructors began the first day of class by asking for a volunteer. He then got the student to tell him how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. He followed the instructions literally. As humans we tend to assume people will know to do certain things without being told. The issue arises when we try to program computers with the same assumptions.</p>
<p>Looking at a cake box, you&apos;ll probably find a few steps like this one. The first involves preparing the oven and pan, the second describes the process of mixing the ingredients, and the last instructs readers on how to confirm that the cake is made. The instructions are very linear, and keywords are highlighted in bold to help make it clear what needs to be done.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://king.instructure.com/users/11006/files/2531525/preview?verifier=Bc4SC7jpdXFIpAfv2RA4ofBHfCyw1NsxlkZPjz01" class="kg-image" alt="Algorithms vs. Cake Mixes" loading="lazy" width="283" height="367"><figcaption><span>Betty Crocker Cake Box</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One interesting thought, though, is that recipes rarely include decision structures and are largely written as linear, step-by-step processes. Why do we assume that someone baking a cake will open the oven&apos;s door to insert the cake? The instructions don&apos;t say to. Most would say that&apos;s just common sense, but what is common sense? Knowing to infer conditions or to read between the lines is what defines intelligence or common sense. Your computer wouldn&apos;t know to open the oven&apos;s door if this recipe was literally translated to code controlling a robot, but (most) humans would.</p>
<p>As humans, we know to include decision structures within our processes (and recipes), but computers don&apos;t. As programmers, we are responsible for translating human processes into code without leaving out any functionality. Decision structures are something most people don&apos;t have to consider directly but are key to writing even simple programs and algorithms.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Java Decision Structure Basics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Decision structures are sometimes known as control structures.

These keywords control the flow of your code by making decisions. These decisions are based on the result of Boolean expressions, which can be constructed using a type of math called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra?ref=crtv.dev">Boolean algebra</a>. </p>
<p>Conditionals and loops, the two primary forms of decision structures, are foundational to modern programming. Conditionals function like a decision-making crossroad, steering program execution based on specified conditions. Loops, on the other hand, act like a kid saying, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; executing a block of code over and over until a specific condition is satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h3>
<p>The most well-known decision structure is if/else if/else. Anytime you need to apply a condition to your code, you will probably use this decision structure. An &quot;if&quot; statement takes a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the following code will be executed. If an &quot;else if&quot; follows the &quot;if&quot;&apos;s code block, the code following the &quot;else if&quot; will be executed. Finally, if no matches are made to any of the other conditions and an &quot;else&quot; statement is provided, its code will be executed. It&apos;s important to remember that the first expression that evaluates to true will be executed, and no other conditions will be tried. If you want to create code where multiple conditions are evaluated independently, you should create multiple if statements.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The next major decision statement is called a switch. This statement takes in a value and compares it to cases. If no cases match, the default case will be executed. This statement is similar to an if but let&apos;s you write less code in certain situations.</p>

<p></p>
<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>Other types of decision structures include while loops, do-while loops, for loops, and foreach loops. These structures execute their code as long as a condition is true. When that condition is false, they stop, and the program continues on.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>With the exception of super basic short scripts, all programs utilize decision structures. A solid grasp of the behavior associated with each structure and when to use which structure is key for any programmer. Without decision structures, we would be stuck with only linear programming. Such an approach lacks the adaptability necessary to address the complexity of real-world applications.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
